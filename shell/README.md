## Unix Shell

This repository contains the code for a unix shell, that can execute commands, pipe, and change directory. The background tasks were tried to be implemented but it wasnt possible for me  to do so.

This directory contains the following files:
     mytoc.c: Tokenizer used for parsing.
     mytoc.h: Header for tokenizer.
     shell.c: The code for implementing the shell.
     Makefile: Standard Makefile.

To compile:
~~~
$ make all
~~~~

To delete binaries:
~~~
$ make clean
~~~
